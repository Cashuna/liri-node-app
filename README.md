# liri-node-app
First app using node

Meet LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.
To retrieve the data that will power this app, requests are made to the Twitter, Spotify and IMDB APIs. You'll find these Node packages at npmjs.com.
